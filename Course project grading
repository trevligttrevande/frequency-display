Titel of project : Audio frequency analysis visualized on display
Project description : Aim is to analyze the frequency content of analog input and display on LCD screen

### Grading goals
Write code that interacts with LCD Monitor: 
  3 Explore and attempt interaction between an embedded system and a display
  4 The implementation is based on an understanding of the rust memory model and consideration is given to rust's strenghts and weaknesses 
  5 The solution is generalized in such a way that it easily can be transfered into other projects

###Grading goals
Write code that samples ADC input and implement FFT algorithm:
  3 Sample ADC input and apply data to FFT implementation
  4 The implementation of the FFT is based on an understanding of the rust memory model and consideration is given to rust's strenghts and weaknesses 
  5 The FFT algorithm is implemented purely in core-rust and generalized in such a way that it easily can be transfered into other projects


## General grading goals
