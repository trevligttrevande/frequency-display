Titel of project : Audio frequency analysis visualized on display
Project description : Aim is to analyze the frequency content of analog input and display on LCD screen

### Grading goals
Write code that interacts with LCD Monitor: 
  3 Experiment with interaction between an embedded system (LPC4757-EVB) and a display (K430WQA-V4-F LCD monitor)
  4 Design an API for for using the monitor with embedded RUST. 
  5 Implement API with proper documentation, examples and testing.

###Grading goals
Write code that samples ADC input and implement FFT algorithm:
  3 Experiment with ADC input and FFT implementation on LPC4757-EVB.
  4 Design an API for for using Fourier Transforms with embedded RUST. 
  5 Implement API with proper documentation, examples and testing.


## General grading goals
  3 Explore and attempt solutions for the given problem
  4 The implementation is based on an understanding of the rust memory model and consideration is given to rust's strenghts and weaknesses 
  5 The solution is generalized in such a way that it easily can be transfered into other projects
