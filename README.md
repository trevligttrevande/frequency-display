# frequency-display
Project for Are We Embedded Yet? D7018E Embedded Rust course. Aim is to analyze frequency content of analog unput and display on LCD screen.

# HARDWARE
The project will be implemented on a LPC4357-EVB development card using a K430WQA-V4-F LCD monitor.

# TODO
Write code that interacts with LCD Monitor. - Nannap
Write code that samples ADC input. - Trevligttrevande
Implement FFT algorithm.  - Trevligttrevande
Display the FFT on the monitor. (Scaling and update rates and stuff.) - TBD
# Something about xargo, vscode, rust?
Software needed to build the project and how to use it.

# Usage instructions
There is no code to use yet.


# Notes
rustfft - Rust implementation of FFT algorithm.


# Grades and stuff

Project description : Aim is to analyze the frequency content of analog input and display on LCD screen

###Grading goals
Write code that samples ADC input and implement FFT algorithm:
*  3. Experiment with ADC input and FFT implementation on LPC4757-EVB.
*  4. Design an API for for using Fourier Transforms with embedded RUST. 
*  5. Implement API with proper documentation, examples and testing.
